    <h2>Bryce Harper</h2>
      <p>Arguably the best free agent of the last 18 years has a new team. Bryce Harper has agreed to a free agent contract with the Philadelphia Phillies,
         the team announced Friday night. Harper's deal is for 13 years and $330 million and features no opt-out clauses, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.
         The deal is the largest in MLB history, breaking Giancarlo Stanton's previous record $325 million contract he signed with the Marlins in November of 2014.</p>

      <h3>LA Lakers</h3>
        <p>After signing LeBron James over the summer, it seemed like there was good reason for the Los Angeles Lakers to be heavy favorites in Las Vegas to make the playoffs. However,
          due to multiple injuries in the season, the LA Lakers have a long way to go. The Lakers will need to find a new coach after firing Luke Walton.
          In addition to a new coach, the will also need a new head of basketball operations before the NBA draft and 2019 free agency starts. It looks to be like a busy summer for the Lakers.

      <h4>Antonio Brown Saga</h4>
        <p>The three teams that have shown the most interest in trading for wide receiver Antonio Brown are the Oakland Raiders, Washington Redskins and Tennessee Titans,
          league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. But which team would be the best landing spot for Brown?</p>
          <h5>How Would Brown Fit In The Offense?</h5>
            <p> <strong>Turron Davenport, Titans reporter:</strong>Brown averaged 171 targets per season over the past six years. It is highly unlikely he would get that
              many targets in a run-heavy scheme for the Titans. On the surface, Brown and the Titans don't seem like a match. But Brownâ€™s ability to score
              every time he touches the ball would be coveted by a team that desperately needs to become more explosive. Brown had six receptions of 40 yards
              or more last year. The Titans' offense, meanwhile, had only six passing plays of 40 yards or more.</p>
            <p> <strong>Paul Gutierrez, Raiders reporter:</strong> How about ... like a glove? The Raiders have no speed and even less game-breaking ability at receiver on the
              roster. Sure, Brown will be 31 in July, but that"s three years younger than Jordy Nelson, and the Raiders need a deep threat -- badly.</p>
            <p> <strong>John Keim, Redskins reporter:</strong> Brown fits in any offensive system that wants players who can make big plays. Brown wins fast at the line, and
              the Redskins like to use a lot of quick-game passing. And how about this: Since 2013, the Steelers averaged 4.51 yards per carry when
              Brown was on the field on first down and 2.50 when he wasn't. The Redskins love running on first down.</p>
